## Airbnb for Cats ðŸ˜¸

Hello, this is my submission for "iOS Engineer Test Task". My idea was to do an app to rent cats by the day.

I'm using the /api/cats endpoint to get the list of cats, with a random initial value in the *skip* parameter so it's different every time. Then the skip is used for the infinite scroll. With the id of the cat, I'm getting the image with the endpoint /cat/id and also using the tags parameter when the user select a tag on the top list.
I added some mockup data (a json and an image) to prevent doing too many request when I was working on the UI.

I work in blocks of 25 minutes to improve my focus, and I defined the deliverables for each block as follow.

1. Setup and API manager
2. List View
3. Reserve cat View
4. Tags filter
5. Info app view
6. Wrap up
